# Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm a cog developer, those cogs works only on [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). I build cogs that I find useful for myself, and that i believe could be valuable for others to use on their bots. This page might be a bit light on content right now but anyway.
